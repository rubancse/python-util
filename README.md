Slide Title: Cross-Account IAM Roles: Secure Resource Access

(Visual Element: A simplified diagram showing two AWS accounts with an arrow indicating a cross-account IAM role and resource access. You can use icons for AWS services like S3, Lambda, etc.)

Slide Content:

1. Introduction (Brief & Clear):

"Today, we'll cover how to create cross-account IAM roles, a fundamental security practice for enabling secure access to resources across different AWS accounts."
"This method avoids sharing long-term credentials and follows the principle of least privilege."
2. Why Cross-Account Roles? (Value Proposition):

Enhanced Security:
"Eliminates the need for sharing long-term access keys, reducing the risk of credential compromise."
"Centralized permission management in the resource owner's account."
Simplified Access Management:
"Provides granular control over which resources can be accessed and what actions can be performed."
"Streamlines collaboration between teams or organizations with separate AWS accounts."
Auditability:
"All actions performed using the role are logged in CloudTrail, providing clear audit trails."
3. Key Concepts (Simplified Explanation):

Account A (Resource Owner):
"The AWS account that owns the resources to be accessed."
"Creates an IAM role with a trust policy allowing Account B to assume it."
Account B (User/Service Account):
"The AWS account that needs to access resources in Account A."
"Configures users or services to assume the IAM role in Account A."
IAM Role:
"A set of permissions that allows temporary access to AWS resources."
"Trust policy defines which principals (accounts) can assume the role."
"Permissions policy defines what actions the role can perform."
AssumeRole:
"The API call used by Account B to assume the IAM role in Account A."
"Returns temporary security credentials that grant access to resources."
4. High-Level Steps (Simplified Flow):

Step 1: Create IAM Role in Account A:
"Define a trust policy allowing Account B's principal to assume the role."
"Attach a permissions policy granting access to specific resources."
Step 2: Configure Account B to Assume the Role:
"Use the AssumeRole API call or configure services (like EC2, Lambda) to assume the role."
"Use the temporary credentials returned by AssumeRole to access resources in Account A."
5. Best Practices (Quick Tips):

Principle of Least Privilege:
"Grant only the necessary permissions to the role."
External IDs:
"Use external IDs in the trust policy to prevent confused deputy problems."
Regular Auditing:
"Review and update IAM policies regularly."
Use IAM Conditions:
"Further restrict access using IAM conditions."
6. Q&A (Open the Floor):

"Any questions?"
Design Considerations:

Keep it concise: Use bullet points and short sentences.
Use visuals: Diagrams and icons make the concepts easier to understand.
Highlight key terms: Use bold text or different colors to emphasize important concepts.
Maintain consistency: Use a consistent font and color scheme.
Focus on the "why" and "how": Explain the benefits and provide a clear overview of the process.
Example Diagram Elements:

Two boxes representing AWS accounts (Account A and Account B).
An arrow from Account B to Account A labeled "AssumeRole".
An IAM role icon within Account A.
AWS service icons within Account A (S3, Lambda, etc.).
A cloudtrail icon to show audit logs.
By following this outline, you can create a clear and informative slide that effectively communicates the fundamentals of cross-account IAM roles to your team.
