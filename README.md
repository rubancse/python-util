1) S3 creates an event when a new file is uploaded.
2)The S3 event triggers an AWS Lambda function. Â  
3)The Lambda function uses the Databricks Jobs API to start a Databricks job, passing the S3 file path as a parameter.
The Databricks job processes the file.

4)This is the most direct and versatile way to start Databricks jobs programmatically. You'll need to make HTTP POST requests to the API endpoint.
curl -n -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_databricks_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_id": 123,
    "notebook_params": {
      "input_date": "2025-03-26",
      "data_source": "s3://your-bucket/data/"
    },
    "run_name": "Programmatic Run - March 26"
  }' \
  "https://<your_databricks_workspace>/api/2.1/jobs/run-now"

5) Get information about a specific job run
curl -n -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_databricks_token>" \
  "https://<your_databricks_workspace>/api/2.1/jobs/runs/get?run_id=456"

**Step 6: Create an S3 event**

Create an S3 event that triggers the Lambda function when a file is uploaded to the S3 bucket. You can 
do this by going to the Events section in the Lambda console and creating a new event with the 
following settings:

* Event type: Object created
* Event source: Your S3 bucket name
* Prefix: Your file prefix (e.g., `my-files/`)
* Suffix: Your file suffix (e.g., `.csv`)

**Step 7: Deploy and test**

Deploy your Lambda function and wait for the file to
